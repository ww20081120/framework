# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-core/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** → MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**❌ NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**✅ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**

   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**

   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:

   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:

   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:

   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ✅ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ❌ FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ⚠️ PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:

   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:

   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

# Document Sharding Task

## Purpose

- Split a large document into multiple smaller documents based on level 2 sections
- Create a folder structure to organize the sharded documents
- Maintain all content integrity including code blocks, diagrams, and markdown formatting

## Primary Method: Automatic with markdown-tree

[[LLM: First, check if markdownExploder is set to true in .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/core-config.yaml. If it is, attempt to run the command: `md-tree explode {input file} {output path}`.

If the command succeeds, inform the user that the document has been sharded successfully and STOP - do not proceed further.

If the command fails (especially with an error indicating the command is not found or not available), inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is enabled but the md-tree command is not available. Please either:

1. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`
2. Or set markdownExploder to false in .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/core-config.yaml

**IMPORTANT: STOP HERE - do not proceed with manual sharding until one of the above actions is taken.**"

If markdownExploder is set to false, inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is currently false. For better performance and reliability, you should:

1. Set markdownExploder to true in .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/core-config.yaml
2. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`

I will now proceed with the manual sharding process."

Then proceed with the manual method below ONLY if markdownExploder is false.]]

### Installation and Usage

1. **Install globally**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser
   ```

2. **Use the explode command**:

   ```bash
   # For PRD
   md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd

   # For Architecture
   md-tree explode docs/architecture.md docs/architecture

   # For any document
   md-tree explode [source-document] [destination-folder]
   ```

3. **What it does**:
   - Automatically splits the document by level 2 sections
   - Creates properly named files
   - Adjusts heading levels appropriately
   - Handles all edge cases with code blocks and special markdown

If the user has @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser installed, use it and skip the manual process below.

---

## Manual Method (if @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser is not available or user indicated manual method)

### Task Instructions

1. Identify Document and Target Location

- Determine which document to shard (user-provided path)
- Create a new folder under `docs/` with the same name as the document (without extension)
- Example: `docs/prd.md` → create folder `docs/prd/`

2. Parse and Extract Sections

CRITICAL AEGNT SHARDING RULES:

1. Read the entire document content
2. Identify all level 2 sections (## headings)
3. For each level 2 section:
   - Extract the section heading and ALL content until the next level 2 section
   - Include all subsections, code blocks, diagrams, lists, tables, etc.
   - Be extremely careful with:
     - Fenced code blocks (```) - ensure you capture the full block including closing backticks and account for potential misleading level 2's that are actually part of a fenced section example
     - Mermaid diagrams - preserve the complete diagram syntax
     - Nested markdown elements
     - Multi-line content that might contain ## inside code blocks

CRITICAL: Use proper parsing that understands markdown context. A ## inside a code block is NOT a section header.]]

### 3. Create Individual Files

For each extracted section:

1. **Generate filename**: Convert the section heading to lowercase-dash-case

   - Remove special characters
   - Replace spaces with dashes
   - Example: "## Tech Stack" → `tech-stack.md`

2. **Adjust heading levels**:

   - The level 2 heading becomes level 1 (# instead of ##) in the sharded new document
   - All subsection levels decrease by 1:

   ```txt
     - ### → ##
     - #### → ###
     - ##### → ####
     - etc.
   ```

3. **Write content**: Save the adjusted content to the new file

### 4. Create Index File

Create an `index.md` file in the sharded folder that:

1. Contains the original level 1 heading and any content before the first level 2 section
2. Lists all the sharded files with links:

```markdown
# Original Document Title

[Original introduction content if any]

## Sections

- [Section Name 1](./section-name-1.md)
- [Section Name 2](./section-name-2.md)
- [Section Name 3](./section-name-3.md)
  ...
```

### 5. Preserve Special Content

1. **Code blocks**: Must capture complete blocks including:

   ```language
   content
   ```

2. **Mermaid diagrams**: Preserve complete syntax:

   ```mermaid
   graph TD
   ...
   ```

3. **Tables**: Maintain proper markdown table formatting

4. **Lists**: Preserve indentation and nesting

5. **Inline code**: Preserve backticks

6. **Links and references**: Keep all markdown links intact

7. **Template markup**: If documents contain {{placeholders}} ,preserve exactly

### 6. Validation

After sharding:

1. Verify all sections were extracted
2. Check that no content was lost
3. Ensure heading levels were properly adjusted
4. Confirm all files were created successfully

### 7. Report Results

Provide a summary:

```text
Document sharded successfully:
- Source: [original document path]
- Destination: docs/[folder-name]/
- Files created: [count]
- Sections:
  - section-name-1.md: "Section Title 1"
  - section-name-2.md: "Section Title 2"
  ...
```

## Important Notes

- Never modify the actual content, only adjust heading levels
- Preserve ALL formatting, including whitespace where significant
- Handle edge cases like sections with code blocks containing ## symbols
- Ensure the sharding is reversible (could reconstruct the original from shards)

# Advanced Game Design Elicitation Task

## Purpose

- Provide optional reflective and brainstorming actions to enhance game design content quality
- Enable deeper exploration of game mechanics and player experience through structured elicitation techniques
- Support iterative refinement through multiple game development perspectives
- Apply game-specific critical thinking to design decisions

## Task Instructions

### 1. Game Design Context and Review

[[LLM: When invoked after outputting a game design section:

1. First, provide a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented, with game-specific focus (e.g., "Please review the core mechanics for player engagement and implementation feasibility. Pay special attention to how these mechanics create the intended player experience and whether they're technically achievable with Unity.")

2. If the section contains game flow diagrams, level layouts, or system diagrams, explain each diagram briefly with game development context before offering elicitation options (e.g., "The gameplay loop diagram shows how player actions lead to rewards and progression. Notice how each step maintains player engagement and creates opportunities for skill development.")

3. If the section contains multiple game elements (like multiple mechanics, multiple levels, multiple systems, etc.), inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:

   - The entire section as a whole
   - Individual game elements within the section (specify which element when selecting an action)

4. Then present the action list as specified below.]]

### 2. Ask for Review and Present Game Design Action List

[[LLM: Ask the user to review the drafted game design section. In the SAME message, inform them that they can suggest additions, removals, or modifications, OR they can select an action by number from the 'Advanced Game Design Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions'. If there are multiple game elements in the section, mention they can specify which element(s) to apply the action to. Then, present ONLY the numbered list (0-9) of these actions. Conclude by stating that selecting 9 will proceed to the next section. Await user selection. If an elicitation action (0-8) is chosen, execute it and then re-offer this combined review/elicitation choice. If option 9 is chosen, or if the user provides direct feedback, proceed accordingly.]]

**Present the numbered list (0-9) with this exact format:**

```text
**Advanced Game Design Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions**
Choose an action (0-9 - 9 to bypass - HELP for explanation of these options):

0. Expand or Contract for Target Audience
1. Explain Game Design Reasoning (Step-by-Step)
2. Critique and Refine from Player Perspective
3. Analyze Game Flow and Mechanic Dependencies
4. Assess Alignment with Player Experience Goals
5. Identify Potential Player Confusion and Design Risks
6. Challenge from Critical Game Design Perspective
7. Explore Alternative Game Design Approaches
8. Hindsight Postmortem: The 'If Only...' Game Design Reflection
9. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

### 2. Processing Guidelines

**Do NOT show:**

- The full protocol text with `[[LLM: ...]]` instructions
- Detailed explanations of each option unless executing or the user asks, when giving the definition you can modify to tie its game development relevance
- Any internal template markup

**After user selection from the list:**

- Execute the chosen action according to the game design protocol instructions below
- Ask if they want to select another action or proceed with option 9 once complete
- Continue until user selects option 9 or indicates completion

## Game Design Action Definitions

0. Expand or Contract for Target Audience
   [[LLM: Ask the user whether they want to 'expand' on the game design content (add more detail, elaborate on mechanics, include more examples) or 'contract' it (simplify mechanics, focus on core features, reduce complexity). Also, ask if there's a specific player demographic or experience level they have in mind (casual players, hardcore gamers, children, etc.). Once clarified, perform the expansion or contraction from your current game design role's perspective, tailored to the specified player audience if provided.]]

1. Explain Game Design Reasoning (Step-by-Step)
   [[LLM: Explain the step-by-step game design thinking process that you used to arrive at the current proposal for this game content. Focus on player psychology, engagement mechanics, technical feasibility, and how design decisions support the overall player experience goals.]]

2. Critique and Refine from Player Perspective
   [[LLM: From your current game design role's perspective, review your last output or the current section for potential player confusion, engagement issues, balance problems, or areas for improvement. Consider how players will actually interact with and experience these systems, then suggest a refined version that better serves player enjoyment and understanding.]]

3. Analyze Game Flow and Mechanic Dependencies
   [[LLM: From your game design role's standpoint, examine the content's structure for logical gameplay progression, mechanic interdependencies, and player learning curve. Confirm if game elements are introduced in an effective order that teaches players naturally and maintains engagement throughout the experience.]]

4. Assess Alignment with Player Experience Goals
   [[LLM: Evaluate how well the current game design content contributes to the stated player experience goals and core game pillars. Consider whether the mechanics actually create the intended emotions and engagement patterns. Identify any misalignments between design intentions and likely player reactions.]]

5. Identify Potential Player Confusion and Design Risks
   [[LLM: Based on your game design expertise, brainstorm potential sources of player confusion, overlooked edge cases in gameplay, balance issues, technical implementation risks, or unintended player behaviors that could emerge from the current design. Consider both new and experienced players' perspectives.]]

6. Challenge from Critical Game Design Perspective
   [[LLM: Adopt a critical game design perspective on the current content. If the user specifies another viewpoint (e.g., 'as a casual player', 'as a speedrunner', 'as a mobile player', 'as a technical implementer'), critique the content from that specified perspective. If no other role is specified, play devil's advocate from your game design expertise, arguing against the current design proposal and highlighting potential weaknesses, player experience issues, or implementation challenges. This can include questioning scope creep, unnecessary complexity, or features that don't serve the core player experience.]]

7. Explore Alternative Game Design Approaches
   [[LLM: From your game design role's perspective, first broadly brainstorm a range of diverse approaches to achieving the same player experience goals or solving the same design challenge. Consider different genres, mechanics, interaction models, or technical approaches. Then, from this wider exploration, select and present 2-3 distinct alternative design approaches, detailing the pros, cons, player experience implications, and technical feasibility you foresee for each.]]

8. Hindsight Postmortem: The 'If Only...' Game Design Reflection
   [[LLM: In your current game design persona, imagine this is a postmortem for a shipped game based on the current design content. What's the one 'if only we had designed/considered/tested X...' that your role would highlight from a game design perspective? Include the imagined player reactions, review scores, or development consequences. This should be both insightful and somewhat humorous, focusing on common game design pitfalls.]]

9. Proceed / No Further Actions
   [[LLM: Acknowledge the user's choice to finalize the current game design work, accept the AI's last output as is, or move on to the next step without selecting another action from this list. Prepare to proceed accordingly.]]

## Game Development Context Integration

This elicitation task is specifically designed for game development and should be used in contexts where:

- **Game Mechanics Design**: When defining core gameplay systems and player interactions
- **Player Experience Planning**: When designing for specific emotional responses and engagement patterns
- **Technical Game Architecture**: When balancing design ambitions with implementation realities
- **Game Balance and Progression**: When designing difficulty curves and player advancement systems
- **Platform Considerations**: When adapting designs for different devices and input methods

The questions and perspectives offered should always consider:

- Player psychology and motivation
- Technical feasibility with Unity and C#
- Performance implications for stable frame rate targets
- Cross-platform compatibility (PC, console, mobile)
- Game development best practices and common pitfalls

    title: Epic List
    instruction: |
      Present a high-level list of all epics for user approval. Each epic should have a title and a short (1 sentence) goal statement. This allows the user to review the overall structure before diving into details.

      CRITICAL: Epics MUST be logically sequential following agile best practices:

      - Each epic should be focused on a single phase and it's design from the development-phases section and deliver a significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment of testable functionality
      - Epic 1 must establish Phase 1: Unity Foundation & Core Systems (Project setup, input handling, basic scene management) unless we are adding new functionality to an existing app, while also delivering an initial piece of functionality, remember this when we produce the stories for the first epic!
      - Each subsequent epic builds upon previous epics' functionality delivering major blocks of functionality that provide tangible value to users or business when deployed
      - Not every project needs multiple epics, an epic needs to deliver value. For example, an API, component, or scriptableobject completed can deliver value even if a scene, or gameobject is not complete and planned for a separate epic.
      - Err on the side of less epics, but let the user know your rationale and offer options for splitting them if it seems some are too large or focused on disparate things.
      - Cross Cutting Concerns should flow through epics and stories and not be final stories. For example, adding a logging framework as a last story of an epic, or at the end of a project as a final epic or story would be terrible as we would not have logging from the beginning.

      - "Epic 1: Unity Foundation & Core Systems: Project setup, input handling, basic scene management"
      - "Epic 2: Core Game Mechanics: Player controller, physics systems, basic gameplay loop"

      After the epic list is approved, present each epic with all its stories and acceptance criteria as a complete review unit.

      For each epic provide expanded goal (2-3 sentences describing the objective and value all the stories will achieve).

      CRITICAL STORY SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS:

      - Stories within each epic MUST be logically sequential
      - Each story should be a "vertical slice" delivering complete functionality aside from early enabler stories for project foundation
      - No story should depend on work from a later story or epic
      - Identify and note any direct prerequisite stories
      - Focus on "what" and "why" not "how" (leave technical implementation to Architect) yet be precise enough to support a logical sequential order of operations from story to story.
      - Ensure each story delivers clear user or business value, try to avoid enablers and build them into stories that deliver value.
      - Size stories for AI agent execution: Each story must be completable by a single AI agent in one focused session without context overflow
      - Think "junior developer working for 2-4 hours" - stories must be small, focused, and self-contained
      - If a story seems complex, break it down further as long as it can deliver a vertical slice

- **Existing Game Projects (Brownfield)**: Feature additions, level expansions, and gameplay enhancements
- **Game Team Collaboration**: Multiple specialized roles working together on game features
- **Game Quality Assurance**: Structured testing, performance validation, and gameplay balance
- **Game Documentation**: Professional Game Design Documents, technical architecture, user stories

## How BMad Works for Game Development

### The Core Method

BMad transforms you into a "Player Experience CEO" - directing a team of specialized game development AI agents through structured workflows. Here's how:

1. **You Direct, AI Executes**: You provide game vision and creative decisions; agents handle implementation details
2. **Specialized Game Agents**: Each agent masters one game development role (Designer, Developer, Scrum Master)
3. **Game-Focused Workflows**: Proven patterns guide you from game concept to deployed 2D Unity game
4. **Clean Handoffs**: Fresh context windows ensure agents stay focused and effective for game development

### The Two-Phase Game Development Approach

#### Phase 1: Game Design & Planning (Web UI - Cost Effective)

- Use large context windows for comprehensive game design
- Generate complete Game Design Documents and technical architecture
- Leverage multiple agents for creative brainstorming and mechanics refinement
- Create once, use throughout game development

#### Phase 2: Game Development (IDE - Implementation)

- Shard game design documents into manageable pieces
- Execute focused SM → Dev cycles for game features
- One game story at a time, sequential progress
- Real-time Unity operations, C# coding, and game testing

### The Game Development Loop

```text
1. Game SM Agent (New Chat) → Creates next game story from sharded docs
2. You → Review and approve game story
3. Game Dev Agent (New Chat) → Implements approved game feature in Unity
4. QA Agent (New Chat) → Reviews code and tests gameplay
5. You → Verify game feature completion
6. Repeat until game epic complete
```

### Why This Works for Games

- **Context Optimization**: Clean chats = better AI performance for complex game logic
- **Role Clarity**: Agents don't context-switch = higher quality game features
- **Incremental Progress**: Small game stories = manageable complexity
- **Player-Focused Oversight**: You validate each game feature = quality control
- **Design-Driven**: Game specs guide everything = consistent player experience

### Core Game Development Philosophy

#### Player-First Development

You are developing games as a "Player Experience CEO" - thinking like a game director with unlimited creative resources and a singular vision for player enjoyment.

#### Game Development Principles

1. **MAXIMIZE_PLAYER_ENGAGEMENT**: Push the AI to create compelling gameplay. Challenge mechanics and iterate.
2. **GAMEPLAY_QUALITY_CONTROL**: You are the ultimate arbiter of fun. Review all game features.
3. **CREATIVE_OVERSIGHT**: Maintain the high-level game vision and ensure design alignment.
4. **ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT**: Expect to revisit game mechanics. Game development is not linear.
5. **CLEAR_GAME_INSTRUCTIONS**: Precise game requirements lead to better implementations.
6. **DOCUMENTATION_IS_KEY**: Good game design docs lead to good game features.
7. **START_SMALL_SCALE_FAST**: Test core mechanics, then expand and polish.
8. **EMBRACE_CREATIVE_CHAOS**: Adapt and overcome game development challenges.

## Getting Started with Game Development

### Quick Start Options for Game Development

#### Option 1: Web UI for Game Design

**Best for**: Game designers who want to start with comprehensive planning

1. Navigate to `dist/teams/` (after building)
2. Copy `unity-2d-game-team.txt` content
3. Create new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
4. Upload file with instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
5. Type `/help` to see available game development commands

#### Option 2: IDE Integration for Game Development

**Best for**: Unity developers using Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Trae, Cline, Roo Code, Github Copilot

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
npx bmad-method install
# Select the bmad-2d-unity-game-dev expansion pack when prompted
```

**Installation Steps for Game Development**:

- Choose "Install expansion pack" when prompted
- Select "bmad-2d-unity-game-dev" from the list
- Select your IDE from supported options:
  - **Cursor**: Native AI integration with Unity support
  - **Claude Code**: Anthropic's official IDE
  - **Windsurf**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Trae**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Cline**: VS Code extension with AI features
  - **Roo Code**: Web-based IDE with agent support
  - **GitHub Copilot**: VS Code extension with AI peer programming assistant

**Verify Game Development Installation**:

- `.bmad-core/` folder created with all core agents
- `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/` folder with game development agents
- IDE-specific integration files created
- Game development agents available with `/bmad2du` prefix (per config.yaml)

### Environment Selection Guide for Game Development

**Use Web UI for**:

- Game design document creation and brainstorming
- Cost-effective comprehensive game planning (especially with Gemini)
- Multi-agent game design consultation
- Creative ideation and mechanics refinement

**Use IDE for**:

- Unity project development and C# coding
- Game asset operations and project integration
- Game story management and implementation workflow
- Unity testing, profiling, and debugging

**Cost-Saving Tip for Game Development**: Create large game design documents in web UI, then copy to `docs/game-design-doc.md` and `docs/game-architecture.md` in your Unity project before switching to IDE for development.

### IDE-Only Game Development Workflow Considerations

**Can you do everything in IDE?** Yes, but understand the game development tradeoffs:

**Pros of IDE-Only Game Development**:

- Single environment workflow from design to Unity deployment
- Direct Unity project operations from start
- No copy/paste between environments
- Immediate Unity project integration

**Cons of IDE-Only Game Development**:

- Higher token costs for large game design document creation
- Smaller context windows for comprehensive game planning
- May hit limits during creative brainstorming phases
- Less cost-effective for extensive game design iteration

**CRITICAL RULE for Game Development**:

- **ALWAYS use Game SM agent for story creation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **ALWAYS use Game Dev agent for Unity implementation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **Why this matters**: Game SM and Game Dev agents are specifically optimized for Unity workflows
- **No exceptions**: Even if using bmad-master for design, switch to Game SM → Game Dev for implementation

## Core Configuration for Game Development (core-config.yaml)

**New in V4**: The `expansion-packs/bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/core-config.yaml` file enables BMad to work seamlessly with any Unity project structure, providing maximum flexibility for game development.

### Game Development Configuration

The expansion pack follows the standard BMad configuration patterns. Copy your core-config.yaml file to expansion-packs/bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/ and add Game-specific configurations to your project's `core-config.yaml`:

```yaml
markdownExploder: true

  - docs/game-architecture/3-tech-stack.md
  - docs/game-architecture/8-unity-project-structure.md
```

## Complete Game Development Workflow

### Planning Phase (Web UI Recommended - Especially Gemini for Game Design!)

**Ideal for cost efficiency with Gemini's massive context for game brainstorming:**

**For All Game Projects**:

1. **Game Concept Brainstorming**: `/bmad2du/game-designer` - Use `*game-design-brainstorming` task
2. **Game Brief**: Create foundation game document using `game-brief-tmpl`
3. **Game Design Document Creation**: `/bmad2du/game-designer` - Use `game-design-doc-tmpl` for comprehensive game requirements
4. **Game Architecture Design**: `/bmad2du/game-architect` - Use `game-architecture-tmpl` for Unity technical foundation
5. **Level Design Framework**: `/bmad2du/game-designer` - Use `level-design-doc-tmpl` for level structure planning
6. **Document Preparation**: Copy final documents to Unity project as `docs/game-design-doc.md`, `docs/game-brief.md`, `docs/level-design.md` and `docs/game-architecture.md`

#### Example Game Planning Prompts

**For Game Design Document Creation**:

```text
"I want to build a [genre] 2D game that [core gameplay].
Help me brainstorm mechanics and create a comprehensive Game Design Document."
```

**For Game Architecture Design**:

```text
"Based on this Game Design Document, design a scalable Unity architecture
that can handle [specific game requirements] with stable performance."
```

### Critical Transition: Web UI to Unity IDE

**Once game planning is complete, you MUST switch to IDE for Unity development:**

- **Why**: Unity development workflow requires C# operations, asset management, and real-time Unity testing
- **Cost Benefit**: Web UI is more cost-effective for large game design creation; IDE is optimized for Unity development
- **Required Files**: Ensure `docs/game-design-doc.md` and `docs/game-architecture.md` exist in your Unity project

### Unity IDE Development Workflow

**Prerequisites**: Game planning documents must exist in `docs/` folder of Unity project

1. **Document Sharding** (CRITICAL STEP for Game Development):

   - Documents created by Game Designer/Architect (in Web or IDE) MUST be sharded for development
   - Use core BMad agents or tools to shard:
     a) **Manual**: Use core BMad `shard-doc` task if available
     b) **Agent**: Ask core `@bmad-master` agent to shard documents
   - Shards `docs/game-design-doc.md` → `docs/game-design/` folder
   - Shards `docs/game-architecture.md` → `docs/game-architecture/` folder
   - **WARNING**: Do NOT shard in Web UI - copying many small files to Unity is painful!

2. **Verify Sharded Game Content**:
   - At least one `feature-n.md` file in `docs/game-design/` with game stories in development order
   - Unity system documents and coding standards for game dev agent reference
   - Sharded docs for Game SM agent story creation

Resulting Unity Project Folder Structure:

- `docs/game-design/` - Broken down game design sections
- `docs/game-architecture/` - Broken down Unity architecture sections
- `docs/game-stories/` - Generated game development stories

3. **Game Development Cycle** (Sequential, one game story at a time):

   **CRITICAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT for Unity Development**:

   - **Context windows matter!** Always use fresh, clean context windows
   - **Model selection matters!** Use most powerful thinking model for Game SM story creation
   - **ALWAYS start new chat between Game SM, Game Dev, and QA work**

   **Step 1 - Game Story Creation**:

   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → Select powerful model → `/bmad2du/game-sm` → `*draft`
   - Game SM executes create-game-story task using `game-story-tmpl`
   - Review generated story in `docs/game-stories/`
   - Update status from "Draft" to "Approved"

   **Step 2 - Unity Game Story Implementation**:

   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → `/bmad2du/game-developer`
   - Agent asks which game story to implement
   - Include story file content to save game dev agent lookup time
   - Game Dev follows tasks/subtasks, marking completion
   - Game Dev maintains File List of all Unity/C# changes
   - Game Dev marks story as "Review" when complete with all Unity tests passing

   **Step 3 - Game QA Review**:

   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → Use core `@qa` agent → execute review-story task
   - QA performs senior Unity developer code review
   - QA can refactor and improve Unity code directly
   - QA appends results to story's QA Results section
   - If approved: Status → "Done"
   - If changes needed: Status stays "Review" with unchecked items for game dev

   **Step 4 - Repeat**: Continue Game SM → Game Dev → QA cycle until all game feature stories complete

**Important**: Only 1 game story in progress at a time, worked sequentially until all game feature stories complete.

### Game Story Status Tracking Workflow

Game stories progress through defined statuses:

- **Draft** → **Approved** → **InProgress** → **Done**

Each status change requires user verification and approval before proceeding.

### Game Development Workflow Types

#### Greenfield Game Development

- Game concept brainstorming and mechanics design
- Game design requirements and feature definition
- Unity system architecture and technical design
- Game development execution
- Game testing, performance optimization, and deployment

#### Brownfield Game Enhancement (Existing Unity Projects)

**Key Concept**: Brownfield game development requires comprehensive documentation of your existing Unity project for AI agents to understand game mechanics, Unity patterns, and technical constraints.

**Brownfield Game Enhancement Workflow**:

Since this expansion pack doesn't include specific brownfield templates, you'll adapt the existing templates:

1. **Upload Unity project to Web UI** (GitHub URL, files, or zip)
2. **Create adapted Game Design Document**: `/bmad2du/game-designer` - Modify `game-design-doc-tmpl` to include:

   - Analysis of existing game systems
   - Integration points for new features
   - Compatibility requirements
   - Risk assessment for changes

3. **Game Architecture Planning**:

   - Use `/bmad2du/game-architect` with `game-architecture-tmpl`
   - Focus on how new features integrate with existing Unity systems
   - Plan for gradual rollout and testing

4. **Story Creation for Enhancements**:
   - Use `/bmad2du/game-sm` with `*create-game-story`
   - Stories should explicitly reference existing code to modify
   - Include integration testing requirements

**When to Use Each Game Development Approach**:

**Full Game Enhancement Workflow** (Recommended for):

- Major game feature additions
- Game system modernization
- Complex Unity integrations
- Multiple related gameplay changes

**Quick Story Creation** (Use when):

- Single, focused game enhancement
- Isolated gameplay fixes
- Small feature additions
- Well-documented existing Unity game

**Critical Success Factors for Game Development**:

1. **Game Documentation First**: Always document existing code thoroughly before making changes
2. **Unity Context Matters**: Provide agents access to relevant Unity scripts and game systems
3. **Gameplay Integration Focus**: Emphasize compatibility and non-breaking changes to game mechanics
4. **Incremental Approach**: Plan for gradual rollout and extensive game testing

## Document Creation Best Practices for Game Development

### Required File Naming for Game Framework Integration

- `docs/game-design-doc.md` - Game Design Document
- `docs/game-architecture.md` - Unity System Architecture Document

**Why These Names Matter for Game Development**:

- Game agents automatically reference these files during Unity development
- Game sharding tasks expect these specific filenames
- Game workflow automation depends on standard naming

### Cost-Effective Game Document Creation Workflow

**Recommended for Large Game Documents (Game Design Document, Game Architecture):**

1. **Use Web UI**: Create game documents in web interface for cost efficiency
2. **Copy Final Output**: Save complete markdown to your Unity project
3. **Standard Names**: Save as `docs/game-design-doc.md` and `docs/game-architecture.md`
4. **Switch to Unity IDE**: Use IDE agents for Unity development and smaller game documents

### Game Document Sharding

Game templates with Level 2 headings (`##`) can be automatically sharded:

**Original Game Design Document**:

```markdown
## Core Gameplay Mechanics

## Player Progression System

## Level Design Framework

## Technical Requirements
```

**After Sharding**:

- `docs/game-design/core-gameplay-mechanics.md`
- `docs/game-design/player-progression-system.md`
- `docs/game-design/level-design-framework.md`
- `docs/game-design/technical-requirements.md`

Use the `shard-doc` task or `@kayvan/markdown-tree-parser` tool for automatic game document sharding.

## Game Agent System

### Core Game Development Team

| Agent            | Role              | Primary Functions                           | When to Use                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `game-designer`  | Game Designer     | Game mechanics, creative design, GDD        | Game concept, mechanics, creative direction |
| `game-developer` | Unity Developer   | C# implementation, Unity optimization       | All Unity development tasks                 |
| `game-sm`        | Game Scrum Master | Game story creation, sprint planning        | Game project management, workflow           |
| `game-architect` | Game Architect    | Unity system design, technical architecture | Complex Unity systems, performance planning |

**Note**: For QA and other roles, use the core BMad agents (e.g., `@qa` from bmad-core).

### Game Agent Interaction Commands

#### IDE-Specific Syntax for Game Development
