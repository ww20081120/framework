# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Create Game Story Task

## Purpose

To identify the next logical game story based on project progress and epic definitions, and then to prepare a comprehensive, self-contained, and actionable story file using the `Game Story Template`. This task ensures the story is enriched with all necessary technical context, Unity-specific requirements, and acceptance criteria, making it ready for efficient implementation by a Game Developer Agent with minimal need for additional research or finding its own context.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Load Core Configuration and Check Workflow

- Load `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/core-config.yaml` from the project root
- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story creation. You can either: 1) Copy core-config.yaml from GITHUB bmad-core/ and configure it for your game project OR 2) Run the BMad installer against your project to upgrade and add the file automatically. Please add and configure before proceeding."
- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `gdd.*`, `gamearchitecture.*`, `workflow.*`

### 1. Identify Next Story for Preparation

#### 1.1 Locate Epic Files and Review Existing Stories

- Based on `gddSharded` from config, locate epic files (sharded location/pattern or monolithic GDD sections)
- If `devStoryLocation` has story files, load the highest `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` file
- **If highest story exists:**
  - Verify status is 'Done'. If not, alert user: "ALERT: Found incomplete story! File: {lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md Status: [current status] You should fix this story first, but would you like to accept risk & override to create the next story in draft?"
  - If proceeding, select next sequential story in the current epic
  - If epic is complete, prompt user: "Epic {epicNum} Complete: All stories in Epic {epicNum} have been completed. Would you like to: 1) Begin Epic {epicNum + 1} with story 1 2) Select a specific story to work on 3) Cancel story creation"
  - **CRITICAL**: NEVER automatically skip to another epic. User MUST explicitly instruct which story to create.
- **If no story files exist:** The next story is ALWAYS 1.1 (first story of first epic)
- Announce the identified story to the user: "Identified next story for preparation: {epicNum}.{storyNum} - {Story Title}"

### 2. Gather Story Requirements and Previous Story Context

- Extract story requirements from the identified epic file or GDD section
- If previous story exists, review Dev Agent Record sections for:
  - Completion Notes and Debug Log References
  - Implementation deviations and technical decisions
  - Unity-specific challenges (prefab issues, scene management, performance)
  - Asset pipeline decisions and optimizations
- Extract relevant insights that inform the current story's preparation

### 3. Gather Architecture Context

#### 3.1 Determine Architecture Reading Strategy

- **If `gamearchitectureVersion: >= v3` and `gamearchitectureSharded: true`**: Read `{gamearchitectureShardedLocation}/index.md` then follow structured reading order below
- **Else**: Use monolithic `gamearchitectureFile` for similar sections

#### 3.2 Read Architecture Documents Based on Story Type

**For ALL Game Stories:** tech-stack.md, unity-project-structure.md, coding-standards.md, testing-resilience-architecture.md

**For Gameplay/Mechanics Stories, additionally:** gameplay-systems-architecture.md, component-architecture-details.md, physics-config.md, input-system.md, state-machines.md, game-data-models.md

**For UI/UX Stories, additionally:** ui-architecture.md, ui-components.md, ui-state-management.md, scene-management.md

**For Backend/Services Stories, additionally:** game-data-models.md, data-persistence.md, save-system.md, analytics-integration.md, multiplayer-architecture.md

**For Graphics/Rendering Stories, additionally:** rendering-pipeline.md, shader-guidelines.md, sprite-management.md, particle-systems.md

**For Audio Stories, additionally:** audio-architecture.md, audio-mixing.md, sound-banks.md

#### 3.3 Extract Story-Specific Technical Details

Extract ONLY information directly relevant to implementing the current story. Do NOT invent new patterns, systems, or standards not in the source documents.

Extract:

- Specific Unity components and MonoBehaviours the story will use
- Unity Package Manager dependencies and their APIs (e.g., Cinemachine, Input System, URP)
- Package-specific configurations and setup requirements
- Prefab structures and scene organization requirements
- Input system bindings and configurations
- Physics settings and collision layers
- UI canvas and layout specifications
- Asset naming conventions and folder structures
- Performance budgets (target FPS, memory limits, draw calls)
- Platform-specific considerations (mobile vs desktop)
- Testing requirements specific to Unity features

ALWAYS cite source documents: `[Source: gamearchitecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`

### 4. Unity-Specific Technical Analysis

#### 4.1 Package Dependencies Analysis

- Identify Unity Package Manager packages required for the story
- Document package versions from manifest.json
- Note any package-specific APIs or components being used
- List package configuration requirements (e.g., Input System settings, URP asset config)
- Identify any third-party Asset Store packages and their integration points

#### 4.2 Scene and Prefab Planning

- Identify which scenes will be modified or created
- List prefabs that need to be created or updated
- Document prefab variant requirements
- Specify scene loading/unloading requirements

#### 4.3 Component Architecture

- Define MonoBehaviour scripts needed

- List sprite/texture requirements with resolution specs
- Define animation clips and animator controllers needed
- Specify audio clips and their import settings
- Document any shader or material requirements
- Note any package-specific assets (e.g., URP materials, Input Action maps)

### 5. Populate Story Template with Full Context

- Create new story file: `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` using Game Story Template
- Fill in basic story information: Title, Status (Draft), Story statement, Acceptance Criteria from Epic/GDD
- **`Dev Notes` section (CRITICAL):**

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**

   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**

   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:

   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:

   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:

   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ✅ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ❌ FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ⚠️ PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:

   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:

   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

# Game Development Change Navigation Checklist

**Purpose:** To systematically guide the Game SM agent and user through analysis and planning when a significant change (performance issue, platform constraint, technical blocker, gameplay feedback) is identified during Unity game development.

**Instructions:** Review each item with the user. Mark `[x]` for completed/confirmed, `[N/A]` if not applicable, or add notes for discussion points.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - GAME CHANGE NAVIGATION

Changes during game development are common - performance issues, platform constraints, gameplay feedback, and technical limitations are part of the process.

Before proceeding, understand:

1. This checklist is for SIGNIFICANT changes affecting game architecture or features
2. Minor tweaks (shader adjustments, UI positioning) don't require this process
3. The goal is to maintain playability while adapting to technical realities
4. Performance and player experience are paramount

Required context:

- The triggering issue (performance metrics, crash logs, feedback)
- Current development state (implemented features, current sprint)
- Access to GDD, technical specs, and performance budgets
- Understanding of remaining features and milestones

APPROACH:
This is an interactive process. Discuss performance implications, platform constraints, and player impact. The user makes final decisions, but provide expert Unity/game dev guidance.

REMEMBER: Game development is iterative. Changes often lead to better gameplay and performance.]]

---

## 1. Understand the Trigger & Context

[[LLM: Start by understanding the game-specific issue. Ask technical questions:

- What performance metrics triggered this? (FPS, memory, load times)
- Is this platform-specific or universal?
- Can we reproduce it consistently?
- What Unity profiler data do we have?
- Is this a gameplay issue or technical constraint?

Focus on measurable impacts and technical specifics.]]

- [ ] **Identify Triggering Element:** Clearly identify the game feature/system revealing the issue.
- [ ] **Define the Issue:** Articulate the core problem precisely.
  - [ ] Performance bottleneck (CPU/GPU/Memory)?
  - [ ] Platform-specific limitation?
  - [ ] Unity engine constraint?
  - [ ] Gameplay/balance issue from playtesting?
  - [ ] Asset pipeline or build size problem?
  - [ ] Third-party SDK/plugin conflict?
- [ ] **Assess Performance Impact:** Document specific metrics (current FPS, target FPS, memory usage, build size).
- [ ] **Gather Technical Evidence:** Note profiler data, crash logs, platform test results, player feedback.

## 2. Game Feature Impact Assessment

[[LLM: Game features are interconnected. Evaluate systematically:

1. Can we optimize the current feature without changing gameplay?
2. Do dependent features need adjustment?
3. Are there platform-specific workarounds?
4. Does this affect our performance budget allocation?

Consider both technical and gameplay impacts.]]

- [ ] **Analyze Current Sprint Features:**
  - [ ] Can the current feature be optimized (LOD, pooling, batching)?
  - [ ] Does it need gameplay simplification?
  - [ ] Should it be platform-specific (high-end only)?
- [ ] **Analyze Dependent Systems:**
  - [ ] Review all game systems interacting with the affected feature.
  - [ ] Do physics systems need adjustment?
  - [ ] Are UI/HUD systems impacted?
  - [ ] Do save/load systems require changes?
  - [ ] Are multiplayer systems affected?
- [ ] **Summarize Feature Impact:** Document effects on gameplay systems and technical architecture.

## 3. Game Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis

[[LLM: Game documentation drives development. Check each artifact:

1. Does this invalidate GDD mechanics?
2. Are technical architecture assumptions still valid?
3. Do performance budgets need reallocation?
4. Are platform requirements still achievable?

Missing conflicts cause performance issues later.]]

- [ ] **Review GDD:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with core gameplay mechanics?
  - [ ] Do game features need scaling for performance?
  - [ ] Are progression systems affected?
  - [ ] Do balance parameters need adjustment?
- [ ] **Review Technical Architecture:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with Unity architecture (scene structure, prefab hierarchy)?
  - [ ] Are component systems impacted?
  - [ ] Do shader/rendering approaches need revision?
  - [ ] Are data structures optimal for the scale?
- [ ] **Review Performance Specifications:**
  - [ ] Are target framerates still achievable?
  - [ ] Do memory budgets need reallocation?
  - [ ] Are load time targets realistic?
  - [ ] Do we need platform-specific targets?
- [ ] **Review Asset Specifications:**
  - [ ] Do texture resolutions need adjustment?
  - [ ] Are model poly counts appropriate?
  - [ ] Do audio compression settings need changes?
  - [ ] Is the animation budget sustainable?
- [ ] **Summarize Artifact Impact:** List all game documents requiring updates.

## 4. Path Forward Evaluation

[[LLM: Present game-specific solutions with technical trade-offs:

1. What's the performance gain?
2. How much rework is required?
3. What's the player experience impact?
4. Are there platform-specific solutions?
5. Is this maintainable across updates?

Be specific about Unity implementation details.]]

- [ ] **Option 1: Optimization Within Current Design:**
  - [ ] Can performance be improved through Unity optimizations?
    - [ ] Object pooling implementation?
    - [ ] LOD system addition?
    - [ ] Texture atlasing?
    - [ ] Draw call batching?
    - [ ] Shader optimization?
  - [ ] Define specific optimization techniques.
  - [ ] Estimate performance improvement potential.
- [ ] **Option 2: Feature Scaling/Simplification:**
  - [ ] Can the feature be simplified while maintaining fun?
  - [ ] Identify specific elements to scale down.
  - [ ] Define platform-specific variations.
  - [ ] Assess player experience impact.
- [ ] **Option 3: Architecture Refactor:**
  - [ ] Would restructuring improve performance significantly?
  - [ ] Identify Unity-specific refactoring needs:
    - [ ] Scene organization changes?
    - [ ] Prefab structure optimization?
    - [ ] Component system redesign?
    - [ ] State machine optimization?
  - [ ] Estimate development effort.
- [ ] **Option 4: Scope Adjustment:**
  - [ ] Can we defer features to post-launch?
  - [ ] Should certain features be platform-exclusive?
  - [ ] Do we need to adjust milestone deliverables?
- [ ] **Select Recommended Path:** Choose based on performance gain vs. effort.

## 5. Game Development Change Proposal Components

[[LLM: The proposal must include technical specifics:

1. Performance metrics (before/after projections)
2. Unity implementation details
3. Platform-specific considerations
4. Testing requirements
5. Risk mitigation strategies

Make it actionable for game developers.]]

(Ensure all points from previous sections are captured)

- [ ] **Technical Issue Summary:** Performance/technical problem with metrics.
- [ ] **Feature Impact Summary:** Affected game systems and dependencies.
- [ ] **Performance Projections:** Expected improvements from chosen solution.
- [ ] **Implementation Plan:** Unity-specific technical approach.
- [ ] **Platform Considerations:** Any platform-specific implementations.
- [ ] **Testing Strategy:** Performance benchmarks and validation approach.
- [ ] **Risk Assessment:** Technical risks and mitigation plans.
- [ ] **Updated Game Stories:** Revised stories with technical constraints.

## 6. Final Review & Handoff

[[LLM: Game changes require technical validation. Before concluding:

1. Are performance targets clearly defined?
2. Is the Unity implementation approach clear?
3. Do we have rollback strategies?
4. Are test scenarios defined?
5. Is platform testing covered?

Get explicit approval on technical approach.

FINAL REPORT:
Provide a technical summary:

- Performance issue and root cause
- Chosen solution with expected gains
- Implementation approach in Unity
- Testing and validation plan
- Timeline and milestone impacts

Keep it technically precise and actionable.]]

- [ ] **Review Checklist:** Confirm all technical aspects discussed.
- [ ] **Review Change Proposal:** Ensure Unity implementation details are clear.
- [ ] **Performance Validation:** Define how we'll measure success.
- [ ] **User Approval:** Obtain approval for technical approach.
- [ ] **Developer Handoff:** Ensure game-dev agent has all technical details needed.
