# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-core/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** ‚Üí MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**‚ùå NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**‚úÖ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

# Document Sharding Task

## Purpose

- Split a large document into multiple smaller documents based on level 2 sections
- Create a folder structure to organize the sharded documents
- Maintain all content integrity including code blocks, diagrams, and markdown formatting

## Primary Method: Automatic with markdown-tree

[[LLM: First, check if markdownExploder is set to true in .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/core-config.yaml. If it is, attempt to run the command: `md-tree explode {input file} {output path}`.

If the command succeeds, inform the user that the document has been sharded successfully and STOP - do not proceed further.

If the command fails (especially with an error indicating the command is not found or not available), inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is enabled but the md-tree command is not available. Please either:

1. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`
2. Or set markdownExploder to false in .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/core-config.yaml

**IMPORTANT: STOP HERE - do not proceed with manual sharding until one of the above actions is taken.**"

If markdownExploder is set to false, inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is currently false. For better performance and reliability, you should:

1. Set markdownExploder to true in .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/core-config.yaml
2. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`

I will now proceed with the manual sharding process."

Then proceed with the manual method below ONLY if markdownExploder is false.]]

### Installation and Usage

1. **Install globally**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser
   ```

2. **Use the explode command**:

   ```bash
   # For PRD
   md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd

   # For Architecture
   md-tree explode docs/architecture.md docs/architecture

   # For any document
   md-tree explode [source-document] [destination-folder]
   ```

3. **What it does**:
   - Automatically splits the document by level 2 sections
   - Creates properly named files
   - Adjusts heading levels appropriately
   - Handles all edge cases with code blocks and special markdown

If the user has @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser installed, use it and skip the manual process below.

---

## Manual Method (if @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser is not available or user indicated manual method)

### Task Instructions

1. Identify Document and Target Location

- Determine which document to shard (user-provided path)
- Create a new folder under `docs/` with the same name as the document (without extension)
- Example: `docs/prd.md` ‚Üí create folder `docs/prd/`

2. Parse and Extract Sections

CRITICAL AEGNT SHARDING RULES:

1. Read the entire document content
2. Identify all level 2 sections (## headings)
3. For each level 2 section:
   - Extract the section heading and ALL content until the next level 2 section
   - Include all subsections, code blocks, diagrams, lists, tables, etc.
   - Be extremely careful with:
     - Fenced code blocks (```) - ensure you capture the full block including closing backticks and account for potential misleading level 2's that are actually part of a fenced section example
     - Mermaid diagrams - preserve the complete diagram syntax
     - Nested markdown elements
     - Multi-line content that might contain ## inside code blocks

CRITICAL: Use proper parsing that understands markdown context. A ## inside a code block is NOT a section header.]]

### 3. Create Individual Files

For each extracted section:

1. **Generate filename**: Convert the section heading to lowercase-dash-case

   - Remove special characters
   - Replace spaces with dashes
   - Example: "## Tech Stack" ‚Üí `tech-stack.md`

2. **Adjust heading levels**:

   - The level 2 heading becomes level 1 (# instead of ##) in the sharded new document
   - All subsection levels decrease by 1:

   ```txt
     - ### ‚Üí ##
     - #### ‚Üí ###
     - ##### ‚Üí ####
     - etc.
   ```

3. **Write content**: Save the adjusted content to the new file

### 4. Create Index File

Create an `index.md` file in the sharded folder that:

1. Contains the original level 1 heading and any content before the first level 2 section
2. Lists all the sharded files with links:

```markdown
# Original Document Title

[Original introduction content if any]

## Sections

- [Section Name 1](./section-name-1.md)
- [Section Name 2](./section-name-2.md)
- [Section Name 3](./section-name-3.md)
  ...
```

### 5. Preserve Special Content

1. **Code blocks**: Must capture complete blocks including:

   ```language
   content
   ```

2. **Mermaid diagrams**: Preserve complete syntax:

   ```mermaid
   graph TD
   ...
   ```

3. **Tables**: Maintain proper markdown table formatting

4. **Lists**: Preserve indentation and nesting

5. **Inline code**: Preserve backticks

6. **Links and references**: Keep all markdown links intact

7. **Template markup**: If documents contain {{placeholders}} ,preserve exactly

### 6. Validation

After sharding:

1. Verify all sections were extracted
2. Check that no content was lost
3. Ensure heading levels were properly adjusted
4. Confirm all files were created successfully

### 7. Report Results

Provide a summary:

```text
Document sharded successfully:
- Source: [original document path]
- Destination: docs/[folder-name]/
- Files created: [count]
- Sections:
  - section-name-1.md: "Section Title 1"
  - section-name-2.md: "Section Title 2"
  ...
```

## Important Notes

- Never modify the actual content, only adjust heading levels
- Preserve ALL formatting, including whitespace where significant
- Handle edge cases like sections with code blocks containing ## symbols
- Ensure the sharding is reversible (could reconstruct the original from shards)

# Document an Existing Project

## Purpose

Generate comprehensive documentation for existing projects optimized for AI development agents. This task creates structured reference materials that enable AI agents to understand project context, conventions, and patterns for effective contribution to any codebase.

## Task Instructions

### 1. Initial Project Analysis

**CRITICAL:** First, check if a PRD or requirements document exists in context. If yes, use it to focus your documentation efforts on relevant areas only.

**IF PRD EXISTS**:

- Review the PRD to understand what enhancement/feature is planned
- Identify which modules, services, or areas will be affected
- Focus documentation ONLY on these relevant areas
- Skip unrelated parts of the codebase to keep docs lean

**IF NO PRD EXISTS**:
Ask the user:

"I notice you haven't provided a PRD or requirements document. To create more focused and useful documentation, I recommend one of these options:

1. **Create a PRD first** - Would you like me to help create a brownfield PRD before documenting? This helps focus documentation on relevant areas.

2. **Provide existing requirements** - Do you have a requirements document, epic, or feature description you can share?

3. **Describe the focus** - Can you briefly describe what enhancement or feature you're planning? For example:
   - 'Adding payment processing to the user service'
   - 'Refactoring the authentication module'
   - 'Integrating with a new third-party API'

4. **Document everything** - Or should I proceed with comprehensive documentation of the entire codebase? (Note: This may create excessive documentation for large projects)

Please let me know your preference, or I can proceed with full documentation if you prefer."

Based on their response:

- If they choose option 1-3: Use that context to focus documentation
- If they choose option 4 or decline: Proceed with comprehensive analysis below

Begin by conducting analysis of the existing project. Use available tools to:

1. **Project Structure Discovery**: Examine the root directory structure, identify main folders, and understand the overall organization
2. **Technology Stack Identification**: Look for package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, etc. to identify languages, frameworks, and dependencies
3. **Build System Analysis**: Find build scripts, CI/CD configurations, and development commands
4. **Existing Documentation Review**: Check for README files, docs folders, and any existing documentation
5. **Code Pattern Analysis**: Sample key files to understand coding patterns, naming conventions, and architectural approaches

Ask the user these elicitation questions to better understand their needs:

- What is the primary purpose of this project?
- Are there any specific areas of the codebase that are particularly complex or important for agents to understand?
- What types of tasks do you expect AI agents to perform on this project? (e.g., bug fixes, feature additions, refactoring, testing)
- Are there any existing documentation standards or formats you prefer?
- What level of technical detail should the documentation target? (junior developers, senior developers, mixed team)
- Is there a specific feature or enhancement you're planning? (This helps focus documentation)

### 2. Deep Codebase Analysis

CRITICAL: Before generating documentation, conduct extensive analysis of the existing codebase:

1. **Explore Key Areas**:
   - Entry points (main files, index files, app initializers)
   - Configuration files and environment setup
   - Package dependencies and versions
   - Build and deployment configurations
   - Test suites and coverage

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**:
   - "I see you're using [technology X]. Are there any custom patterns or conventions I should document?"
   - "What are the most critical/complex parts of this system that developers struggle with?"
   - "Are there any undocumented 'tribal knowledge' areas I should capture?"
   - "What technical debt or known issues should I document?"
   - "Which parts of the codebase change most frequently?"

3. **Map the Reality**:
   - Identify ACTUAL patterns used (not theoretical best practices)
   - Find where key business logic lives
   - Locate integration points and external dependencies
   - Document workarounds and technical debt
   - Note areas that differ from standard patterns

**IF PRD PROVIDED**: Also analyze what would need to change for the enhancement

### 3. Core Documentation Generation

[[LLM: Generate a comprehensive BROWNFIELD architecture document that reflects the ACTUAL state of the codebase.

**CRITICAL**: This is NOT an aspirational architecture document. Document what EXISTS, including:

- Technical debt and workarounds
- Inconsistent patterns between different parts
- Legacy code that can't be changed
- Integration constraints
- Performance bottlenecks

**Document Structure**:

# [Project Name] Brownfield Architecture Document

## Introduction

This document captures the CURRENT STATE of the [Project Name] codebase, including technical debt, workarounds, and real-world patterns. It serves as a reference for AI agents working on enhancements.

### Document Scope

[If PRD provided: "Focused on areas relevant to: {enhancement description}"]
[If no PRD: "Comprehensive documentation of entire system"]

### Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| [Date] | 1.0 | Initial brownfield analysis | [Analyst] |

## Quick Reference - Key Files and Entry Points

### Critical Files for Understanding the System

- **Main Entry**: `src/index.js` (or actual entry point)
- **Configuration**: `config/app.config.js`, `.env.example`
- **Core Business Logic**: `src/services/`, `src/domain/`
- **API Definitions**: `src/routes/` or link to OpenAPI spec
- **Database Models**: `src/models/` or link to schema files
- **Key Algorithms**: [List specific files with complex logic]

### If PRD Provided - Enhancement Impact Areas

[Highlight which files/modules will be affected by the planned enhancement]

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

### Actual Tech Stack (from package.json/requirements.txt)

| Category | Technology | Version | Notes |
|----------|------------|---------|--------|
| Runtime | Node.js | 16.x | [Any constraints] |
| Framework | Express | 4.18.2 | [Custom middleware?] |
| Database | PostgreSQL | 13 | [Connection pooling setup] |

etc...

### Repository Structure Reality Check

- Type: [Monorepo/Polyrepo/Hybrid]
- Package Manager: [npm/yarn/pnpm]
- Notable: [Any unusual structure decisions]

## Source Tree and Module Organization

### Project Structure (Actual)

```text
project-root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/     # HTTP request handlers
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/        # Business logic (NOTE: inconsistent patterns between user and payment services)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/          # Database models (Sequelize)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/           # Mixed bag - needs refactoring
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ legacy/          # DO NOT MODIFY - old payment system still in use
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/               # Jest tests (60% coverage)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/             # Build and deployment scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config/              # Environment configs
```

### Key Modules and Their Purpose

- **User Management**: `src/services/userService.js` - Handles all user operations
- **Authentication**: `src/middleware/auth.js` - JWT-based, custom implementation
- **Payment Processing**: `src/legacy/payment.js` - CRITICAL: Do not refactor, tightly coupled
- **[List other key modules with their actual files]**

## Data Models and APIs

### Data Models

Instead of duplicating, reference actual model files:
- **User Model**: See `src/models/User.js`
- **Order Model**: See `src/models/Order.js`
- **Related Types**: TypeScript definitions in `src/types/`

### API Specifications

- **OpenAPI Spec**: `docs/api/openapi.yaml` (if exists)
- **Postman Collection**: `docs/api/postman-collection.json`
- **Manual Endpoints**: [List any undocumented endpoints discovered]

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

### Critical Technical Debt

1. **Payment Service**: Legacy code in `src/legacy/payment.js` - tightly coupled, no tests
2. **User Service**: Different pattern than other services, uses callbacks instead of promises
3. **Database Migrations**: Manually tracked, no proper migration tool
4. **[Other significant debt]**

### Workarounds and Gotchas

- **Environment Variables**: Must set `NODE_ENV=production` even for staging (historical reason)
- **Database Connections**: Connection pool hardcoded to 10, changing breaks payment service
- **[Other workarounds developers need to know]**

## Integration Points and External Dependencies

### External Services

| Service | Purpose | Integration Type | Key Files |
|---------|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Stripe | Payments | REST API | `src/integrations/stripe/` |
| SendGrid | Emails | SDK | `src/services/emailService.js` |

etc...

### Internal Integration Points

```

### Debugging and Troubleshooting

- **Logs**: Check `logs/app.log` for application logs
- **Debug Mode**: Set `DEBUG=app:*` for verbose logging
- **Common Issues**: See `docs/troubleshooting.md`]]

### 4. Document Delivery

1. **In Web UI (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude)**:
   - Present the entire document in one response (or multiple if too long)
   - Tell user to copy and save as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` or `docs/project-architecture.md`
   - Mention it can be sharded later in IDE if needed

2. **In IDE Environment**:
   - Create the document as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`
   - Inform user this single document contains all architectural information
   - Can be sharded later using PO agent if desired

The document should be comprehensive enough that future agents can understand:

- The actual state of the system (not idealized)
- Where to find key files and logic
- What technical debt exists
- What constraints must be respected
- If PRD provided: What needs to change for the enhancement]]

### 5. Quality Assurance

CRITICAL: Before finalizing the document:

1. **Accuracy Check**: Verify all technical details match the actual codebase
2. **Completeness Review**: Ensure all major system components are documented
3. **Focus Validation**: If user provided scope, verify relevant areas are emphasized
4. **Clarity Assessment**: Check that explanations are clear for AI agents
5. **Navigation**: Ensure document has clear section structure for easy reference

Apply the advanced elicitation task after major sections to refine based on user feedback.

## Success Criteria

- Single comprehensive brownfield architecture document created
- Document reflects REALITY including technical debt and workarounds
- Key files and modules are referenced with actual paths
- Models/APIs reference source files rather than duplicating content
- If PRD provided: Clear impact analysis showing what needs to change
- Document enables AI agents to navigate and understand the actual codebase
- Technical constraints and "gotchas" are clearly documented

## Notes

- This task creates ONE document that captures the TRUE state of the system
- References actual files rather than duplicating content when possible
- Documents technical debt, workarounds, and constraints honestly
- For brownfield projects with PRD: Provides clear enhancement impact analysis
- The goal is PRACTICAL documentation for AI agents doing real work

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**

   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**

   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:

   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:

   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:

   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ‚úÖ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ‚ùå FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:

   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:

   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

# Advanced Game Design Elicitation Task

## Purpose

- Provide optional reflective and brainstorming actions to enhance game design content quality
- Enable deeper exploration of game mechanics and player experience through structured elicitation techniques
- Support iterative refinement through multiple game development perspectives
- Apply game-specific critical thinking to design decisions

## Task Instructions

### 1. Game Design Context and Review

[[LLM: When invoked after outputting a game design section:

1. First, provide a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented, with game-specific focus (e.g., "Please review the core mechanics for player engagement and implementation feasibility. Pay special attention to how these mechanics create the intended player experience and whether they're technically achievable with Unity.")

2. If the section contains game flow diagrams, level layouts, or system diagrams, explain each diagram briefly with game development context before offering elicitation options (e.g., "The gameplay loop diagram shows how player actions lead to rewards and progression. Notice how each step maintains player engagement and creates opportunities for skill development.")

3. If the section contains multiple game elements (like multiple mechanics, multiple levels, multiple systems, etc.), inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:

   - The entire section as a whole
   - Individual game elements within the section (specify which element when selecting an action)

4. Then present the action list as specified below.]]

### 2. Ask for Review and Present Game Design Action List

[[LLM: Ask the user to review the drafted game design section. In the SAME message, inform them that they can suggest additions, removals, or modifications, OR they can select an action by number from the 'Advanced Game Design Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions'. If there are multiple game elements in the section, mention they can specify which element(s) to apply the action to. Then, present ONLY the numbered list (0-9) of these actions. Conclude by stating that selecting 9 will proceed to the next section. Await user selection. If an elicitation action (0-8) is chosen, execute it and then re-offer this combined review/elicitation choice. If option 9 is chosen, or if the user provides direct feedback, proceed accordingly.]]

**Present the numbered list (0-9) with this exact format:**

```text
**Advanced Game Design Elicitation & Brainstorming Actions**
Choose an action (0-9 - 9 to bypass - HELP for explanation of these options):

0. Expand or Contract for Target Audience
1. Explain Game Design Reasoning (Step-by-Step)
2. Critique and Refine from Player Perspective
3. Analyze Game Flow and Mechanic Dependencies
4. Assess Alignment with Player Experience Goals
5. Identify Potential Player Confusion and Design Risks
6. Challenge from Critical Game Design Perspective
7. Explore Alternative Game Design Approaches
8. Hindsight Postmortem: The 'If Only...' Game Design Reflection
9. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

### 2. Processing Guidelines

**Do NOT show:**

- The full protocol text with `[[LLM: ...]]` instructions
- Detailed explanations of each option unless executing or the user asks, when giving the definition you can modify to tie its game development relevance
- Any internal template markup

**After user selection from the list:**

- Execute the chosen action according to the game design protocol instructions below
- Ask if they want to select another action or proceed with option 9 once complete
- Continue until user selects option 9 or indicates completion

## Game Design Action Definitions

0. Expand or Contract for Target Audience
   [[LLM: Ask the user whether they want to 'expand' on the game design content (add more detail, elaborate on mechanics, include more examples) or 'contract' it (simplify mechanics, focus on core features, reduce complexity). Also, ask if there's a specific player demographic or experience level they have in mind (casual players, hardcore gamers, children, etc.). Once clarified, perform the expansion or contraction from your current game design role's perspective, tailored to the specified player audience if provided.]]

1. Explain Game Design Reasoning (Step-by-Step)
   [[LLM: Explain the step-by-step game design thinking process that you used to arrive at the current proposal for this game content. Focus on player psychology, engagement mechanics, technical feasibility, and how design decisions support the overall player experience goals.]]

2. Critique and Refine from Player Perspective
   [[LLM: From your current game design role's perspective, review your last output or the current section for potential player confusion, engagement issues, balance problems, or areas for improvement. Consider how players will actually interact with and experience these systems, then suggest a refined version that better serves player enjoyment and understanding.]]

3. Analyze Game Flow and Mechanic Dependencies
   [[LLM: From your game design role's standpoint, examine the content's structure for logical gameplay progression, mechanic interdependencies, and player learning curve. Confirm if game elements are introduced in an effective order that teaches players naturally and maintains engagement throughout the experience.]]

4. Assess Alignment with Player Experience Goals
   [[LLM: Evaluate how well the current game design content contributes to the stated player experience goals and core game pillars. Consider whether the mechanics actually create the intended emotions and engagement patterns. Identify any misalignments between design intentions and likely player reactions.]]

5. Identify Potential Player Confusion and Design Risks
   [[LLM: Based on your game design expertise, brainstorm potential sources of player confusion, overlooked edge cases in gameplay, balance issues, technical implementation risks, or unintended player behaviors that could emerge from the current design. Consider both new and experienced players' perspectives.]]

6. Challenge from Critical Game Design Perspective
   [[LLM: Adopt a critical game design perspective on the current content. If the user specifies another viewpoint (e.g., 'as a casual player', 'as a speedrunner', 'as a mobile player', 'as a technical implementer'), critique the content from that specified perspective. If no other role is specified, play devil's advocate from your game design expertise, arguing against the current design proposal and highlighting potential weaknesses, player experience issues, or implementation challenges. This can include questioning scope creep, unnecessary complexity, or features that don't serve the core player experience.]]

7. Explore Alternative Game Design Approaches
   [[LLM: From your game design role's perspective, first broadly brainstorm a range of diverse approaches to achieving the same player experience goals or solving the same design challenge. Consider different genres, mechanics, interaction models, or technical approaches. Then, from this wider exploration, select and present 2-3 distinct alternative design approaches, detailing the pros, cons, player experience implications, and technical feasibility you foresee for each.]]

8. Hindsight Postmortem: The 'If Only...' Game Design Reflection
   [[LLM: In your current game design persona, imagine this is a postmortem for a shipped game based on the current design content. What's the one 'if only we had designed/considered/tested X...' that your role would highlight from a game design perspective? Include the imagined player reactions, review scores, or development consequences. This should be both insightful and somewhat humorous, focusing on common game design pitfalls.]]

9. Proceed / No Further Actions
   [[LLM: Acknowledge the user's choice to finalize the current game design work, accept the AI's last output as is, or move on to the next step without selecting another action from this list. Prepare to proceed accordingly.]]

## Game Development Context Integration

This elicitation task is specifically designed for game development and should be used in contexts where:

- **Game Mechanics Design**: When defining core gameplay systems and player interactions
- **Player Experience Planning**: When designing for specific emotional responses and engagement patterns
- **Technical Game Architecture**: When balancing design ambitions with implementation realities
- **Game Balance and Progression**: When designing difficulty curves and player advancement systems
- **Platform Considerations**: When adapting designs for different devices and input methods

The questions and perspectives offered should always consider:

- Player psychology and motivation
- Technical feasibility with Unity and C#
- Performance implications for stable frame rate targets
- Cross-platform compatibility (PC, console, mobile)
- Game development best practices and common pitfalls

          This document outlines the complete technical architecture for {{project_name}}, a 2D game built with Unity and C#. It serves as the technical foundation for AI-driven game development, ensuring consistency and scalability across all game systems.

          This architecture is designed to support the gameplay mechanics defined in the Game Design Document while maintaining stable performance and cross-platform compatibility.
      - id: starter-template
        title: Starter Template or Existing Project
        instruction: |
          Before proceeding further with game architecture design, check if the project is based on a Unity template or existing codebase:

          1. Review the GDD and brainstorming brief for any mentions of:
          - Unity templates (2D Core, 2D Mobile, 2D URP, etc.)
          - Existing Unity projects being used as a foundation
          - Asset Store packages or game development frameworks
          - Previous game projects to be cloned or adapted

          2. If a starter template or existing project is mentioned:
          - Ask the user to provide access via one of these methods:
            - Link to the Unity template documentation
            - Upload/attach the project files (for small projects)
            - Share a link to the project repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
          - Analyze the starter/existing project to understand:
            - Pre-configured Unity version and render pipeline
            - Project structure and organization patterns
            - Built-in packages and dependencies
            - Existing architectural patterns and conventions
            - Any limitations or constraints imposed by the starter
          - Use this analysis to inform and align your architecture decisions

          3. If no starter template is mentioned but this is a greenfield project:
          - Suggest appropriate Unity templates based on the target platform
          - Explain the benefits (faster setup, best practices, package integration)
          - Let the user decide whether to use one

          4. If the user confirms no starter template will be used:
          - Proceed with architecture design from scratch
          - Note that manual setup will be required for all Unity configuration

          Document the decision here before proceeding with the architecture design. If none, just say N/A

          2. Provide your recommendation with clear rationale
          3. Get user confirmation before finalizing
          4. These patterns should align with the GDD's technical assumptions and project goals

          Common Unity patterns to consider:
          - Component patterns (MonoBehaviour composition, ScriptableObject data)
          - Game management patterns (Singleton managers, Event systems, State machines)
          - Data patterns (ScriptableObject configuration, Save/Load systems)
          - Unity-specific patterns (Object pooling, Coroutines, Unity Events)

      4. Get explicit user approval for each selection
      5. Document exact versions (avoid "latest" - pin specific versions)
      6. This table is the single source of truth - all other docs must reference these choices

      Key decisions to finalize - before displaying the table, ensure you are aware of or ask the user about:

      - Unity version and render pipeline
      - Target platforms and their specific requirements
      - Unity Package Manager packages and versions
      - Third-party assets or frameworks
      - Platform SDKs and services
      - Build and deployment tools

# Game Architect Solution Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Game Architect to validate the technical design and architecture before game development execution. The Game Architect should systematically work through each item, ensuring the game architecture is robust, scalable, performant, and aligned with the Game Design Document requirements.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. game-architecture.md - The primary game architecture document (check docs/game-architecture.md)
2. game-design-doc.md - Game Design Document for game requirements alignment (check docs/game-design-doc.md)
3. Any system diagrams referenced in the architecture
4. Unity project structure documentation
5. Game balance and configuration specifications
6. Platform target specifications

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

GAME PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the game project type by checking:

- Is this a 2D Unity game project?
- What platforms are targeted?
- What are the core game mechanics from the GDD?
- Are there specific performance requirements?

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Deep Analysis - Don't just check boxes, thoroughly analyze each item against the provided documentation
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or quotes from the documents when validating
3. Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps, not just confirm what's present
4. Performance Focus - Consider frame rate impact and mobile optimization for every architectural decision

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

- **Braces**: Use Allman style (braces on a new line).
- **Spacing**: Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- **`using` directives**: Place all `using` directives at the top of the file, outside the namespace.
- **`this` keyword**: Only use `this` when necessary to distinguish between a field and a local variable/parameter.

## Unity Architecture Patterns

### Scene Lifecycle Management

**Loading and Transitioning Between Scenes:**

```csharp
// SceneLoader.cs - A singleton for managing scene transitions.
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
using System.Collections;

public class SceneLoader : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static SceneLoader Instance { get; private set; }

    private void Awake()
    {
        if (Instance != null && Instance != this)
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
            return;
        }
        Instance = this;
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
    }

    public void LoadGameScene()
    {
        // Example of loading the main game scene, perhaps with a loading screen first.
        StartCoroutine(LoadSceneAsync("Level01"));
    }

    private IEnumerator LoadSceneAsync(string sceneName)
    {
        // Load a loading screen first (optional)
        SceneManager.LoadScene("LoadingScreen");

        // Wait a frame for the loading screen to appear
        yield return null;

        // Begin loading the target scene in the background
        AsyncOperation asyncLoad = SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync(sceneName);

        // Don't activate the scene until it's fully loaded
        asyncLoad.allowSceneActivation = false;

        // Wait until the asynchronous scene fully loads
        while (!asyncLoad.isDone)
        {
            // Here you could update a progress bar with asyncLoad.progress
            if (asyncLoad.progress >= 0.9f)
            {
                // Scene is loaded, allow activation
                asyncLoad.allowSceneActivation = true;
            }
            yield return null;
        }
    }
}
```

### MonoBehaviour Lifecycle

**Understanding Core MonoBehaviour Events:**

```csharp
// Example of a standard MonoBehaviour lifecycle
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    // AWAKE: Called when the script instance is being loaded.
    // Use for initialization before the game starts. Good for caching component references.
    private void Awake()
    {
        Debug.Log("PlayerController Awake!");
    }

    // ONENABLE: Called when the object becomes enabled and active.
    // Good for subscribing to events.
    private void OnEnable()
    {
        // Example: UIManager.OnGamePaused += HandleGamePaused;
    }

    // START: Called on the frame when a script is enabled just before any of the Update methods are called the first time.
    // Good for logic that depends on other objects being initialized.
    private void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("PlayerController Start!");
    }

    // FIXEDUPDATE: Called every fixed framerate frame.
    // Use for physics calculations (e.g., applying forces to a Rigidbody).
    private void FixedUpdate()
    {
        // Handle Rigidbody movement here.
    }

    // UPDATE: Called every frame.
    // Use for most game logic, like handling input and non-physics movement.
    private void Update()
    {
        // Handle input and non-physics movement here.
    }

    // LATEUPDATE: Called every frame, after all Update functions have been called.
    // Good for camera logic that needs to track a target that moves in Update.
    private void LateUpdate()
    {
        // Camera follow logic here.
    }

    // ONDISABLE: Called when the behaviour becomes disabled or inactive.
    // Good for unsubscribing from events to prevent memory leaks.
    private void OnDisable()
    {
        // Example: UIManager.OnGamePaused -= HandleGamePaused;
    }

    // ONDESTROY: Called when the MonoBehaviour will be destroyed.
    // Good for any final cleanup.
    private void OnDestroy()
    {
        Debug.Log("PlayerController Destroyed!");
    }
}
```

### Game Object Patterns

**Component-Based Architecture:**

```csharp
// Player.cs - The main GameObject class, acts as a container for components.
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(PlayerMovement), typeof(PlayerHealth))]
public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    public PlayerMovement Movement { get; private set; }
    public PlayerHealth Health { get; private set; }

    private void Awake()
    {
        Movement = GetComponent<PlayerMovement>();
        Health = GetComponent<PlayerHealth>();
    }
}

// PlayerHealth.cs - A component responsible only for health logic.
public class PlayerHealth : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private int _maxHealth = 100;
    private int _currentHealth;

    private void Awake()
    {
        _currentHealth = _maxHealth;
    }

    public void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        _currentHealth -= amount;
        if (_currentHealth <= 0)
        {
            Die();
        }
    }

    private void Die()
    {
        // Death logic
        Debug.Log("Player has died.");
        gameObject.SetActive(false);
    }
}
```

### Data-Driven Design with ScriptableObjects

**Define Data Containers:**

```csharp
// EnemyData.cs - A ScriptableObject to hold data for an enemy type.
using UnityEngine;

[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "NewEnemyData", menuName = "Game/Enemy Data")]
public class EnemyData : ScriptableObject
{
    public string enemyName;
    public int maxHealth;
    public float moveSpeed;
    public int damage;
    public Sprite sprite;
}

// Enemy.cs - A MonoBehaviour that uses the EnemyData.
public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private EnemyData _enemyData;
    private int _currentHealth;

    private void Start()
    {
        _currentHealth = _enemyData.maxHealth;
        GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>().sprite = _enemyData.sprite;
    }

    // ... other enemy logic
}
```

### System Management

**Singleton Managers:**

```csharp
// GameManager.cs - A singleton to manage the overall game state.
using UnityEngine;

public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static GameManager Instance { get; private set; }

    public int Score { get; private set; }

    private void Awake()
    {
        if (Instance != null && Instance != this)
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
            return;
        }
        Instance = this;
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject); // Persist across scenes
    }

    public void AddScore(int amount)
    {
        Score += amount;
    }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Object Pooling

**Required for High-Frequency Objects (e.g., bullets, effects):**

```csharp
// ObjectPool.cs - A generic object pooling system.
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class ObjectPool : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private GameObject _prefabToPool;
    [SerializeField] private int _initialPoolSize = 20;

    private Queue<GameObject> _pool = new Queue<GameObject>();

    private void Start()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < _initialPoolSize; i++)
        {
            GameObject obj = Instantiate(_prefabToPool);
            obj.SetActive(false);
            _pool.Enqueue(obj);
        }
    }

    public GameObject GetObjectFromPool()
    {
        if (_pool.Count > 0)
        {
            GameObject obj = _pool.Dequeue();
            obj.SetActive(true);
            return obj;
        }
        // Optionally, expand the pool if it's empty.
        return Instantiate(_prefabToPool);
    }

    public void ReturnObjectToPool(GameObject obj)
    {
        obj.SetActive(false);
        _pool.Enqueue(obj);
    }
}
```

### Frame Rate Optimization

**Update Loop Optimization:**

- Avoid expensive calls like `GetComponent`, `FindObjectOfType`, or `Instantiate` inside `Update()` or `FixedUpdate()`. Cache references in `Awake()` or `Start()`.
- Use Coroutines or simple timers for logic that doesn't need to run every single frame.

**Physics Optimization:**

- Adjust the "Physics 2D Settings" in Project Settings, especially the "Layer Collision Matrix", to prevent unnecessary collision checks.
- Use `Rigidbody2D.Sleep()` for objects that are not moving to save CPU cycles.

## Input Handling

### Cross-Platform Input (New Input System)

**Input Action Asset:** Create an Input Action Asset (`.inputactions`) to define controls.

**PlayerInput Component:**

- Add the `PlayerInput` component to the player GameObject.
- Set its "Actions" to the created Input Action Asset.
- Set "Behavior" to "Invoke Unity Events" to easily hook up methods in the Inspector, or "Send Messages" to use methods like `OnMove`, `OnFire`.

```csharp
// PlayerInputHandler.cs - Example of handling input via messages.
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;

public class PlayerInputHandler : MonoBehaviour
{
    private Vector2 _moveInput;

    // This method is called by the PlayerInput component via "Send Messages".
    // The action must be named "Move" in the Input Action Asset.
    public void OnMove(InputValue value)
    {
        _moveInput = value.Get<Vector2>();
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        // Use _moveInput to control the player
        transform.Translate(new Vector3(_moveInput.x, _moveInput.y, 0) * Time.deltaTime * 5f);
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

**Asset Loading Error Handling:**

- When using Addressables or `Resources.Load`, always check if the loaded asset is null before using it.

```csharp
// Load a sprite and use a fallback if it fails
Sprite playerSprite = Resources.Load<Sprite>("Sprites/Player");
if (playerSprite == null)
{
    Debug.LogError("Player sprite not found! Using default.");
    playerSprite = Resources.Load<Sprite>("Sprites/Default");
}
```

### Runtime Error Recovery

**Assertions and Logging:**

- Use `Debug.Assert(condition, "Message")` to check for critical conditions that must be true.
- Use `Debug.LogError("Message")` for fatal errors and `Debug.LogWarning("Message")` for non-critical issues.

```csharp
// Example of using an assertion to ensure a component exists.
private Rigidbody2D _rb;

void Awake()
{
    _rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    Debug.Assert(_rb != null, "Rigidbody2D component not found on player!");
}
```

## Testing Standards

### Unit Testing (Edit Mode)

**Game Logic Testing:**

```csharp
// HealthSystemTests.cs - Example test for a simple health system.
using NUnit.Framework;
using UnityEngine;

public class HealthSystemTests
{
    [Test]
    public void TakeDamage_ReducesHealth()
    {
        // Arrange
        var gameObject = new GameObject();
        var healthSystem = gameObject.AddComponent<PlayerHealth>();
        // Note: This is a simplified example. You might need to mock dependencies.

        // Act
        healthSystem.TakeDamage(20);

        // Assert
        // This requires making health accessible for testing, e.g., via a public property or method.
        // Assert.AreEqual(80, healthSystem.CurrentHealth);
    }
}
```

### Integration Testing (Play Mode)

**Scene Testing:**

- Play Mode tests run in a live scene, allowing you to test interactions between multiple components and systems.
- Use `yield return null;` to wait for the next frame.

```csharp
// PlayerJumpTest.cs
using System.Collections;
using NUnit.Framework;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.TestTools;

public class PlayerJumpTest
{
    [UnityTest]
    public IEnumerator PlayerJumps_WhenSpaceIsPressed()
    {
        // Arrange
        var player = new GameObject().AddComponent<PlayerController>();
        var initialY = player.transform.position.y;

        // Act
        // Simulate pressing the jump button (requires setting up the input system for tests)
        // For simplicity, we'll call a public method here.
        // player.Jump();

        // Wait for a few physics frames
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.5f);

        // Assert
        Assert.Greater(player.transform.position.y, initialY);
    }
}
```

## File Organization

## Development Workflow

### Story Implementation Process

1. **Read Story Requirements:**

   - Understand acceptance criteria
   - Identify technical requirements
   - Review performance constraints

2. **Plan Implementation:**

   - Identify files to create/modify
   - Consider Unity's component-based architecture
   - Plan testing approach

3. **Implement Feature:**

   - Write clean C# code following all guidelines
   - Use established patterns
   - Maintain stable FPS performance

4. **Test Implementation:**

   - Write edit mode tests for game logic
   - Write play mode tests for integration testing
   - Test cross-platform functionality
   - Validate performance targets

5. **Update Documentation:**
   - Mark story checkboxes complete
   - Document any deviations
   - Update architecture if needed

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] C# code compiles without errors or warnings.
- [ ] All automated tests pass.
- [ ] Code follows naming conventions and architectural patterns.
- [ ] No expensive operations in `Update()` loops.
- [ ] Public fields/methods are documented with comments.
- [ ] New assets are organized into the correct folders.

## Performance Targets

### Frame Rate Requirements

- **PC/Console**: Maintain a stable 60+ FPS.
- **Mobile**: Maintain 60 FPS on mid-range devices, minimum 30 FPS on low-end.
- **Optimization**: Use the Unity Profiler to identify and fix performance drops.

### Memory Management

- **Total Memory**: Keep builds under platform-specific limits (e.g., 200MB for a simple mobile game).
- **Garbage Collection**: Minimize GC spikes by avoiding string concatenation, `new` keyword usage in loops, and by pooling objects.

### Loading Performance

- **Initial Load**: Under 5 seconds for game start.
- **Scene Transitions**: Under 2 seconds between scenes. Use asynchronous scene loading.

These guidelines ensure consistent, high-quality game development that meets performance targets and maintains code quality across all implementation stories.

- **Unity-Optimized Build System**: Automated dependency resolution for game assets and scripts
- **Dual Environment Support**: Optimized for both web UIs and game development IDEs
- **Game Development Resources**: Specialized templates, tasks, and checklists for 2D Unity games
- **Performance-First Approach**: Built-in optimization patterns for cross-platform game deployment

### Game Development Focus

- **Target Engine**: Unity 2022 LTS or newer with C# 10+
- **Platform Strategy**: Cross-platform (PC, Console, Mobile) with a focus on 2D
- **Development Approach**: Agile story-driven development with game-specific workflows
- **Performance Target**: Stable frame rate on target devices
- **Architecture**: Component-based architecture using Unity's best practices

### When to Use BMad for Game Development

- **New Game Projects (Greenfield)**: Complete end-to-end game development from concept to deployment
- **Existing Game Projects (Brownfield)**: Feature additions, level expansions, and gameplay enhancements
- **Game Team Collaboration**: Multiple specialized roles working together on game features
- **Game Quality Assurance**: Structured testing, performance validation, and gameplay balance
- **Game Documentation**: Professional Game Design Documents, technical architecture, user stories

## How BMad Works for Game Development

### The Core Method

BMad transforms you into a "Player Experience CEO" - directing a team of specialized game development AI agents through structured workflows. Here's how:

1. **You Direct, AI Executes**: You provide game vision and creative decisions; agents handle implementation details
2. **Specialized Game Agents**: Each agent masters one game development role (Designer, Developer, Scrum Master)
3. **Game-Focused Workflows**: Proven patterns guide you from game concept to deployed 2D Unity game
4. **Clean Handoffs**: Fresh context windows ensure agents stay focused and effective for game development

### The Two-Phase Game Development Approach

#### Phase 1: Game Design & Planning (Web UI - Cost Effective)

- Use large context windows for comprehensive game design
- Generate complete Game Design Documents and technical architecture
- Leverage multiple agents for creative brainstorming and mechanics refinement
- Create once, use throughout game development

#### Phase 2: Game Development (IDE - Implementation)

- Shard game design documents into manageable pieces
- Execute focused SM ‚Üí Dev cycles for game features
- One game story at a time, sequential progress
- Real-time Unity operations, C# coding, and game testing

### The Game Development Loop

```text
1. Game SM Agent (New Chat) ‚Üí Creates next game story from sharded docs
2. You ‚Üí Review and approve game story
3. Game Dev Agent (New Chat) ‚Üí Implements approved game feature in Unity
4. QA Agent (New Chat) ‚Üí Reviews code and tests gameplay
5. You ‚Üí Verify game feature completion
6. Repeat until game epic complete
```

### Why This Works for Games

- **Context Optimization**: Clean chats = better AI performance for complex game logic
- **Role Clarity**: Agents don't context-switch = higher quality game features
- **Incremental Progress**: Small game stories = manageable complexity
- **Player-Focused Oversight**: You validate each game feature = quality control
- **Design-Driven**: Game specs guide everything = consistent player experience

### Core Game Development Philosophy

#### Player-First Development

You are developing games as a "Player Experience CEO" - thinking like a game director with unlimited creative resources and a singular vision for player enjoyment.

#### Game Development Principles

1. **MAXIMIZE_PLAYER_ENGAGEMENT**: Push the AI to create compelling gameplay. Challenge mechanics and iterate.
2. **GAMEPLAY_QUALITY_CONTROL**: You are the ultimate arbiter of fun. Review all game features.
3. **CREATIVE_OVERSIGHT**: Maintain the high-level game vision and ensure design alignment.
4. **ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT**: Expect to revisit game mechanics. Game development is not linear.
5. **CLEAR_GAME_INSTRUCTIONS**: Precise game requirements lead to better implementations.
6. **DOCUMENTATION_IS_KEY**: Good game design docs lead to good game features.
7. **START_SMALL_SCALE_FAST**: Test core mechanics, then expand and polish.
8. **EMBRACE_CREATIVE_CHAOS**: Adapt and overcome game development challenges.

## Getting Started with Game Development

### Quick Start Options for Game Development

#### Option 1: Web UI for Game Design

**Best for**: Game designers who want to start with comprehensive planning

1. Navigate to `dist/teams/` (after building)
2. Copy `unity-2d-game-team.txt` content
3. Create new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
4. Upload file with instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
5. Type `/help` to see available game development commands

#### Option 2: IDE Integration for Game Development

**Best for**: Unity developers using Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Trae, Cline, Roo Code, Github Copilot

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
npx bmad-method install
# Select the bmad-2d-unity-game-dev expansion pack when prompted
```

**Installation Steps for Game Development**:

- Choose "Install expansion pack" when prompted
- Select "bmad-2d-unity-game-dev" from the list
- Select your IDE from supported options:
  - **Cursor**: Native AI integration with Unity support
  - **Claude Code**: Anthropic's official IDE
  - **Windsurf**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Trae**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Cline**: VS Code extension with AI features
  - **Roo Code**: Web-based IDE with agent support
  - **GitHub Copilot**: VS Code extension with AI peer programming assistant

**Verify Game Development Installation**:

- `.bmad-core/` folder created with all core agents
- `.bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/` folder with game development agents
- IDE-specific integration files created
- Game development agents available with `/bmad2du` prefix (per config.yaml)

### Environment Selection Guide for Game Development

**Use Web UI for**:

- Game design document creation and brainstorming
- Cost-effective comprehensive game planning (especially with Gemini)
- Multi-agent game design consultation
- Creative ideation and mechanics refinement

**Use IDE for**:

- Unity project development and C# coding
- Game asset operations and project integration
- Game story management and implementation workflow
- Unity testing, profiling, and debugging

**Cost-Saving Tip for Game Development**: Create large game design documents in web UI, then copy to `docs/game-design-doc.md` and `docs/game-architecture.md` in your Unity project before switching to IDE for development.

### IDE-Only Game Development Workflow Considerations

**Can you do everything in IDE?** Yes, but understand the game development tradeoffs:

**Pros of IDE-Only Game Development**:

- Single environment workflow from design to Unity deployment
- Direct Unity project operations from start
- No copy/paste between environments
- Immediate Unity project integration

**Cons of IDE-Only Game Development**:

- Higher token costs for large game design document creation
- Smaller context windows for comprehensive game planning
- May hit limits during creative brainstorming phases
- Less cost-effective for extensive game design iteration

**CRITICAL RULE for Game Development**:

- **ALWAYS use Game SM agent for story creation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **ALWAYS use Game Dev agent for Unity implementation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **Why this matters**: Game SM and Game Dev agents are specifically optimized for Unity workflows
- **No exceptions**: Even if using bmad-master for design, switch to Game SM ‚Üí Game Dev for implementation

## Core Configuration for Game Development (core-config.yaml)

**New in V4**: The `expansion-packs/bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/core-config.yaml` file enables BMad to work seamlessly with any Unity project structure, providing maximum flexibility for game development.

### Game Development Configuration

The expansion pack follows the standard BMad configuration patterns. Copy your core-config.yaml file to expansion-packs/bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/ and add Game-specific configurations to your project's `core-config.yaml`:

```yaml

```

## Complete Game Development Workflow

### Planning Phase (Web UI Recommended - Especially Gemini for Game Design!)

**Ideal for cost efficiency with Gemini's massive context for game brainstorming:**

**For All Game Projects**:

1. **Game Concept Brainstorming**: `/bmad2du/game-designer` - Use `*game-design-brainstorming` task
2. **Game Brief**: Create foundation game document using `game-brief-tmpl`
3. **Game Design Document Creation**: `/bmad2du/game-designer` - Use `game-design-doc-tmpl` for comprehensive game requirements
4. **Game Architecture Design**: `/bmad2du/game-architect` - Use `game-architecture-tmpl` for Unity technical foundation
5. **Level Design Framework**: `/bmad2du/game-designer` - Use `level-design-doc-tmpl` for level structure planning
6. **Document Preparation**: Copy final documents to Unity project as `docs/game-design-doc.md`, `docs/game-brief.md`, `docs/level-design.md` and `docs/game-architecture.md`

#### Example Game Planning Prompts

"I want to build a [genre] 2D game that [core gameplay].
Help me brainstorm mechanics and create a comprehensive Game Design Document."
```

**For Game Architecture Design**:

```text
"Based on this Game Design Document, design a scalable Unity architecture
that can handle [specific game requirements] with stable performance."
```

### Critical Transition: Web UI to Unity IDE

**Once game planning is complete, you MUST switch to IDE for Unity development:**

- **Why**: Unity development workflow requires C# operations, asset management, and real-time Unity testing
- **Cost Benefit**: Web UI is more cost-effective for large game design creation; IDE is optimized for Unity development
- **Required Files**: Ensure `docs/game-design-doc.md` and `docs/game-architecture.md` exist in your Unity project

### Unity IDE Development Workflow

**Prerequisites**: Game planning documents must exist in `docs/` folder of Unity project

1. **Document Sharding** (CRITICAL STEP for Game Development):

   - Documents created by Game Designer/Architect (in Web or IDE) MUST be sharded for development
   - Use core BMad agents or tools to shard:
     a) **Manual**: Use core BMad `shard-doc` task if available
     b) **Agent**: Ask core `@bmad-master` agent to shard documents
   - Shards `docs/game-design-doc.md` ‚Üí `docs/game-design/` folder
   - Shards `docs/game-architecture.md` ‚Üí `docs/game-architecture/` folder
   - **WARNING**: Do NOT shard in Web UI - copying many small files to Unity is painful!

2. **Verify Sharded Game Content**:
   - At least one `feature-n.md` file in `docs/game-design/` with game stories in development order
   - Unity system documents and coding standards for game dev agent reference
   - Sharded docs for Game SM agent story creation

Resulting Unity Project Folder Structure:

- `docs/game-design/` - Broken down game design sections
- `docs/game-architecture/` - Broken down Unity architecture sections
- `docs/game-stories/` - Generated game development stories

3. **Game Development Cycle** (Sequential, one game story at a time):

   **CRITICAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT for Unity Development**:

   - **Context windows matter!** Always use fresh, clean context windows
   - **Model selection matters!** Use most powerful thinking model for Game SM story creation
   - **ALWAYS start new chat between Game SM, Game Dev, and QA work**

   **Step 1 - Game Story Creation**:

   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** ‚Üí Select powerful model ‚Üí `/bmad2du/game-sm` ‚Üí `*draft`
   - Game SM executes create-game-story task using `game-story-tmpl`
   - Review generated story in `docs/game-stories/`
   - Update status from "Draft" to "Approved"

   **Step 2 - Unity Game Story Implementation**:

   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** ‚Üí `/bmad2du/game-developer`
   - Agent asks which game story to implement
   - Include story file content to save game dev agent lookup time
   - Game Dev follows tasks/subtasks, marking completion
   - Game Dev maintains File List of all Unity/C# changes
   - Game Dev marks story as "Review" when complete with all Unity tests passing

   **Step 3 - Game QA Review**:

   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** ‚Üí Use core `@qa` agent ‚Üí execute review-story task
   - QA performs senior Unity developer code review
   - QA can refactor and improve Unity code directly
   - QA appends results to story's QA Results section
   - If approved: Status ‚Üí "Done"
   - If changes needed: Status stays "Review" with unchecked items for game dev

   **Step 4 - Repeat**: Continue Game SM ‚Üí Game Dev ‚Üí QA cycle until all game feature stories complete

**Important**: Only 1 game story in progress at a time, worked sequentially until all game feature stories complete.

### Game Story Status Tracking Workflow

Game stories progress through defined statuses:

- **Draft** ‚Üí **Approved** ‚Üí **InProgress** ‚Üí **Done**

Each status change requires user verification and approval before proceeding.

### Game Development Workflow Types

#### Greenfield Game Development

- Game concept brainstorming and mechanics design
- Game design requirements and feature definition
- Unity system architecture and technical design
- Game development execution
- Game testing, performance optimization, and deployment

#### Brownfield Game Enhancement (Existing Unity Projects)

**Key Concept**: Brownfield game development requires comprehensive documentation of your existing Unity project for AI agents to understand game mechanics, Unity patterns, and technical constraints.

**Brownfield Game Enhancement Workflow**:

Since this expansion pack doesn't include specific brownfield templates, you'll adapt the existing templates:

1. **Upload Unity project to Web UI** (GitHub URL, files, or zip)
2. **Create adapted Game Design Document**: `/bmad2du/game-designer` - Modify `game-design-doc-tmpl` to include:

   - Analysis of existing game systems
   - Integration points for new features
   - Compatibility requirements
   - Risk assessment for changes

3. **Game Architecture Planning**:

   - Use `/bmad2du/game-architect` with `game-architecture-tmpl`
   - Focus on how new features integrate with existing Unity systems
   - Plan for gradual rollout and testing

4. **Story Creation for Enhancements**:
   - Use `/bmad2du/game-sm` with `*create-game-story`
   - Stories should explicitly reference existing code to modify
   - Include integration testing requirements

**When to Use Each Game Development Approach**:

**Full Game Enhancement Workflow** (Recommended for):

- Major game feature additions
- Game system modernization
- Complex Unity integrations
- Multiple related gameplay changes

**Quick Story Creation** (Use when):

- Single, focused game enhancement
- Isolated gameplay fixes
- Small feature additions
- Well-documented existing Unity game

**Critical Success Factors for Game Development**:

1. **Game Documentation First**: Always document existing code thoroughly before making changes
2. **Unity Context Matters**: Provide agents access to relevant Unity scripts and game systems
3. **Gameplay Integration Focus**: Emphasize compatibility and non-breaking changes to game mechanics
4. **Incremental Approach**: Plan for gradual rollout and extensive game testing

## Document Creation Best Practices for Game Development

### Required File Naming for Game Framework Integration

- `docs/game-design-doc.md` - Game Design Document
- `docs/game-architecture.md` - Unity System Architecture Document

**Why These Names Matter for Game Development**:

- Game agents automatically reference these files during Unity development
- Game sharding tasks expect these specific filenames
- Game workflow automation depends on standard naming

### Cost-Effective Game Document Creation Workflow

**Recommended for Large Game Documents (Game Design Document, Game Architecture):**

1. **Use Web UI**: Create game documents in web interface for cost efficiency
2. **Copy Final Output**: Save complete markdown to your Unity project
3. **Standard Names**: Save as `docs/game-design-doc.md` and `docs/game-architecture.md`
4. **Switch to Unity IDE**: Use IDE agents for Unity development and smaller game documents

### Game Document Sharding

Game templates with Level 2 headings (`##`) can be automatically sharded:

**Original Game Design Document**:

```markdown
## Core Gameplay Mechanics

## Player Progression System

## Level Design Framework

## Technical Requirements
```

**After Sharding**:

- `docs/game-design/core-gameplay-mechanics.md`
- `docs/game-design/player-progression-system.md`
- `docs/game-design/level-design-framework.md`
- `docs/game-design/technical-requirements.md`

Use the `shard-doc` task or `@kayvan/markdown-tree-parser` tool for automatic game document sharding.

## Game Agent System

### Core Game Development Team

| Agent            | Role              | Primary Functions                           | When to Use                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `game-designer`  | Game Designer     | Game mechanics, creative design, GDD        | Game concept, mechanics, creative direction |
| `game-developer` | Unity Developer   | C# implementation, Unity optimization       | All Unity development tasks                 |
| `game-sm`        | Game Scrum Master | Game story creation, sprint planning        | Game project management, workflow           |
| `game-architect` | Game Architect    | Unity system design, technical architecture | Complex Unity systems, performance planning |

**Note**: For QA and other roles, use the core BMad agents (e.g., `@qa` from bmad-core).
